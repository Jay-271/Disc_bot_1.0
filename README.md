# Disc_bot_1.0
Just my discord bot ran with node

Basically, just install the requirements:
# .env openai@4 node discord.js

note - your filetree should look like this

"src" folder
--> index.js
--> "functions" folder
--> "events" folder
--> "commands" folder

"functions" folder
--> handleCommands.js
--> handleEvents.js

"events" folder does not contain anything but is required to be there

"commands" folder
--> "community" folder

"community" folder
--> 8ball.js
--> rizz-generate.js
--> image-generate.js
